                "Final Enigma" is a podcast series exploring the mysteries and the unknowns within and on the intersections of 
                Physics, Neuroscience and AI with the ultimate goal of probing into the depths of the most important final enigma of science: human cosciousness. 
                <br />
                <br />I strongly believe that scientific research into the nature, structure and phenomenology of cosciousness is of the utmost urgency and umportance if humanity is to invent AGI safely.
